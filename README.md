## Description
* Basic coding quiz. Hit the start button and 1 of 5 questions will come up, a timer at the top right corner will start counting down from 80. 
* New question will come up after an answer is selected. 
* The user will be notified by a footer note if their chosen answer was correct or wrong. 
* When a wrong answer is chosen, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. 
* If the timer reaches 0 before the quiz is over, and alert will pop up telling the user they have run out of time, then the page will load a "Try Again?" button to restart the quiz. 
* Once the user has completed the quiz, they will be notified of their score and prompted to enter their initials for the score board. 
* When submitting their initials, the user will then be taken to the high scores page where all submitted scores will be displayed (not including any attempts timed out). 
* The user then has the option to either go back to start the quiz again, or clear the scores.
